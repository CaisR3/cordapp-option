/**
 *  We sub-class 'SingletonSerializeAsToken' to ensure that instances of this class are never serialised by Kryo. When
 *  a flow is check-pointed, the annotated @Suspendable methods and any object referenced from within those annotated
 *  methods are serialised onto the stack. Kryo, the reflection based serialisation framework we use, crawls the object
 *  graph and serialises anything it encounters, producing a graph of serialised objects.
 *
 *  This can cause issues. For example, we do not want to serialise large objects on to the stack or objects which may
 *  reference databases or other external services (which cannot be serialised!). Therefore we mark certain objects
 *  with tokens. When Kryo encounters one of these tokens, it doesn't serialise the object. Instead, it creates a
 *  reference to the type of the object. When flows are de-serialised, the token is used to connect up the object
 *  reference to an instance which should already exist on the stack.
